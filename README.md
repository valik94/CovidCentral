### Project Git Workflow
NEVER code on Main!

**Create Feature Branches** 
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

**Main branch is your production branch, never directly work on it!**

**Starting a new branch**
1. git checkout main (Start new branches from the main branch)
2. git pull (Make sure you have the most recent version)

**Working on the branch** 
3. git checkout feature/my-feature (Make your feature) 
4. git add & git commit (Commit often with meaningful messages !) 
5. git push (So it's not only local)

**Merging main in the BRANCH**
6. git checkout main (To update it)
7. git pull 
8. git checkout feature/my-feature (Back to your feature) 
9. git merge main 
10. Fix conflicts if any 
11. git commit (commit the merge) 
12. git push (So it's not only local)

**Merging the branch back in MAIN** 
13. git checkout main (To merge your branch) 
14. git merge feature/my-feature 
15. Should not be any conflict since you cleaned them in the branch first 
16. git commit (commit the merge) 
17. git push (So it's not only local)

## NEW Workflow 
1. Step 1 - git pull origin main
Make sure to pull all recent changes to main to start the branch-off process.

2. Step 2 - Add a branch 
To add a branch 
```sh
git checkout -b branchname
```
3. Step 3 - work on feature branch
Commit as OFTEN as you can! Commits really matter. Don't do everything in 1 commit.

4. ### Feature complete!

Now that you are done, and everything has been commited, push the `BRANCH` into github.com

```sh
git push origin_branchname_
```
On github, create a pull request bym clicking `pull requests` button, then clicking the `new pull request` button on the apge. Pick your branch then fill out the form to generate pull request.

#this already checks for conflicts for me
#this also shows all file changes made


### If you have a merge conflict github will tell you

- There are 2 was to fix it, 1, github will five you tools (bad way)
- Switch to main, pull all changes, switch back to your branch, MERGE main into your branch and fix conflicts

Once you fixed them, push the branch back out, and your `pull request` will be updated.


#### Merging pull requests
#### Once reviewed and approved by a team member, merge the pull request by clicking green merge pull request button. Now everything will be added to main branch.
